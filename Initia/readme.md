# **What is Initia?**

Initia is an L1 blockchain on Cosmos with application-specific L2s (Layer 2) using Optimistic rollups. Through Initia's architecture, encompassing the L1, L2, and communication layers, developers can easily launch application-specific blockchains as Initia L2s without needing to know complex chain-level infrastructure or run validator sets.

The Initia L1 is an interoperable network that employs MoveVM, the first integration of the Move Smart Contracting Language natively compatible with Cosmos' Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Furthermore, Initia's architecture enables L2s to utilize EVM, WasmVM, or MoveVM while facilitating seamless messaging and bridging between them. Initia uses a robust economic system to align incentives throughout the entire ecosystem.

# **Benefits of Using Initia**
There are several advantages that Initia offers to developers and blockchain users:

- **Easier Development**: Initia's modular design simplifies the L2 development process, making custom blockchain application creation faster and more efficient.
- **Better Scalability**: By promoting L2 rollups, Initia enables faster and cheaper transactions on the blockchain.
- **Higher Security**: Initia inherits the security benefits of the underlying L1 network while allowing developers to implement additional security features within their L2 rollups.

# **Funding**
Binance Labs has invested in Initia, a Layer 1 Network for 0-to-1 Rollups
